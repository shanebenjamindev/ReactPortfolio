                    Back in 2018, I decided to try my best at creating a PHP Watch&apos;s Store Website for my Manager as a Full Stack Web Developer and head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building website for a medical agency,
                    <span className="focus__Text"> also have experiences with Back-End team.</span>
                </p>
            </p>    
            <p>
              My main focus these days is
              <span className="focus__Text"> learn as much as I can</span>. In my
              free time, I spend a lot of time online, on social media, and even
              with AI tools like ChatGPT to learn everything I need to know
              about building websites and to get ideas for my own designs.

              Aside from my passion for web development, I also enjoy jogging
              and reading books. By striving to become the best version of
              myself with a healthy mind and body,<span className="focus__Text"> I can work with dedication and achieve my goals.
